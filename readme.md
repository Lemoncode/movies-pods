# Movie pods

Sample application developed by attendees of a Lemoncode's React / Redux training.

This application will display a list of movies + filters (several views implemented), and display the details of each
movie (edit movie detail, genre in progress)

What you will find in this application:
  - How to implement a React / Redux application.
  - Follow a pods approach to isolate the application.  
  - How to create a simple rest-api and consume a rest based server.
  - How to create a mock json-server.
  - How to work with redux-sagas.
  - How to setup Jest environment, plus implement unit tests on reducers, actions and business code.
  - How to setup a simple react-router based navigation.
